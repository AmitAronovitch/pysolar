## Pysolar ##

Pysolar is a collection of Python libraries for simulating the irradiation of any point on earth by the sun. It includes code for extremely precise ephemeris calculations, and more.

# Note: right now, the latest commits of Pysolar don't work with Python 2.x #

* The latest release, 0.6, is still good: https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar/releases/tag/0.6 but HEAD has just had bunch of changes. They have been validated for Python 3.4, but not the 2.x series. *

Also, the API has changed slightly:

  * Pysolar now expects you to supply a **timezone-aware datetime**, rather than a naive datetime in UTC. If your results seem crazy, this is probably why.
  * Function names are now `lowercase_separated_by_underscores`, in compliance with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names).

## Installation ##

Assuming you have Python 3.4 or higher installed, you can install Pysolar with `pip`:

    sudo pip install pysolar

Documentation now appears at [docs.pysolar.org](http://docs.pysolar.org).

## Support ##

You can email the original author [Brandon Stafford](http://rascalmicro.com) at brandon at pingswept org. Please understand that I wrote (most of) Pysolar around a decade ago when I worked in the solar industry. Now, I'm an electrical engineer who just maintains Pysolar as a fun hobby.

Please report bugs to the issue tracker on Github; I am automatically notified when a new issue is opened.
