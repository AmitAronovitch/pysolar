It includes code for extremely precise ephemeris calculations, and more.\r\n\r\n# Note: right now, the latest commits of Pysolar don't work with Python 2.x #\r\n\r\n* The latest release, 0.6, is still good: https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar/releases/tag/0.6 but HEAD has just had bunch of changes. They have been validated for Python 3.4, but not the 2.x series. *\r\n\r\nAlso, the API has changed slightly:\r\n\r\n  * Pysolar now expects you to supply a **timezone-aware datetime**, rather than a naive datetime in UTC. If your results seem crazy, this is probably why.\r\n  * Function names are now `lowercase_separated_by_underscores`, in compliance with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names).\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\nAssuming you have Python 3.4 or higher installed, you can install Pysolar with `pip`:\r\n\r\n    sudo pip install pysolar\r\n\r\nDocumentation now appears at [docs.pysolar.org](http://docs.pysolar.org).\r\n\r\n## Contributions ##\r\n\r\nAll contributions go through pull requests on Github.\r\n\r\nEditing [the documentation](http://docs.pysolar.org) is particularly easy-- just click the \"Edit on Github\" link at the top of any page.\r\n\r\nCode contributions are welcome under the terms of the GPLv3 license. If you're unfamiliar with Github, you could start with [this guide to working on open source projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).\r\n\r\n## Support ##\r\n\r\nYou can email the original author [Brandon Stafford](http://rascalmicro.com) at brandon at pingswept org. Please understand that I wrote (most of) Pysolar around a decade ago when I worked in the solar industry. Now, I'm an electrical engineer who just maintains Pysolar as a fun hobby.\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs to [the issue tracker on Github](https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar/issues); I am automatically notified when a new issue is opened.\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nPysolar is licensed under [the GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
